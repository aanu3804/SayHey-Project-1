Session :-
[00:00 - 01:00] Opening & Rapport Building
L: Hey, welcome to sayHey. I’m really glad you reached out. I’m here to listen, without any judgment. You can talk about anything that’s on your mind.
U: Uh, thank you... I wasn’t sure if I should call, but I just needed someone to talk to.
L: I hear you. Sometimes just letting things out can feel like a huge relief. Take your time. I’m here for you.

[01:00 - 03:00] Encouraging Expression
U: I’ve just been feeling really overwhelmed lately. College, relationships, my parents... it’s all piling up.
L: That sounds like a lot to carry. Would you like to start with what’s been weighing on you the most lately?
U: I think it’s the pressure to perform well academically. I’m usually good at studies, but lately, I just can’t focus.
L: Hmm. So something that used to come naturally to you is suddenly feeling like a burden now?
U: Yeah… exactly. And that makes me feel like something’s wrong with me.


---

[03:00 - 05:00] Emotional Validation & Reflection
L: It makes sense you’d feel that way. When we don’t feel like ourselves, especially in things we used to do well, it can really shake our confidence.
U: Yes, and I’ve tried talking to my friends, but they just say “it’ll pass” or “don’t overthink.”
L: Sounds like you’re not feeling truly heard or understood by the people around you.
U: Yeah… it feels lonely sometimes, like I’m just pretending everything’s okay.
L: That’s a heavy mask to wear every day. I can feel how hard you’re trying just to hold things together.


---

[05:00 - 07:00] Gentle Exploration & Empathy
L: When you say you can’t focus, is it more about the stress or thoughts that keep coming back?
U: I think it’s thoughts… like “what if I fail” or “I’ll disappoint my parents.”
L: It sounds like there’s a lot of fear underneath — not just about grades but also about letting people down.
U: Yeah, I don’t want to be seen as someone who’s weak.
L: It takes a lot of strength to admit you’re struggling. Reaching out like this — that’s courage, not weakness.


---

[07:00 - 08:30] Empowerment & Reframing
L: Just checking in with you — how are you feeling right now, in this moment, while talking about all this?
U: Honestly… lighter. I wasn’t expecting to feel this heard.
L: That means a lot. You deserve to feel supported. You’re not alone in this — your feelings are valid.
U: Thanks… even just hearing that helps.


---

[08:30 - 09:30] Gentle Closure & Support
L: I know we’re nearing the end of our time, but before we wrap up — is there one small thing you’d like to do differently after this call?
U: Maybe… just give myself a break. Not beat myself up if I have an unproductive day.
L: That sounds like a powerful step. Self-compassion isn’t easy, but it’s such an act of strength.
U: Yeah, I’ll try. Thanks again.


---

[09:30 - 10:00] Ending Warmly
L: I’m really glad you opened up today. You’re doing your best, and that matters. Whenever you need someone to talk to, sayHey is here for you.
U: Thank you… really. This helped more than I thought it would.
